# ohts-buffer_overflow_exploitation
## An in-depth explanation on how buffer overflow vulnerability work covering a theoretical/hypothetical approach and practical/real-world approaches.

Target Environment for the two practical approaches: Windows XP Professional (x86) SP3 (Codes will work straight for this end target. Parameters needs to be changed if other 32 bit architectural Operating Systems are used such as Windows 7 x86, Windows 2003 Server x86 etc.)

Attacked Using: Kali Linux (Any distribution suited)

### Important changes in the exploit codes to be done if using them to get a remote shell
Make sure to generate the shell code according to your own attacking machine's IP address and listening port (LHOST and LPORT). Otherwise it will not work. - This is true for all 2 practical approaches and the extra approach.

### The Explanation Videos Done For Each Approach
In the document named 'Buffer Overflow Exploitation.pdf', you will find brief explanations about what I have done in this repository and relating videos. The video explanations were done for each of the folders (Theoretical approach, 2 Practical approaches and the extra explanation) and you can find those links in this document at each relevant section dedicated to the approaches.
